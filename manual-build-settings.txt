+ Because CocoaPods does not understand that the "fuelpurchase-dev" target has
  a hard, automatic dependency on the "fuelpurchase" target, it doesn't know to
  ignore dependencies for the dev target that overlap with dependencies for the
  main target.  The way the current Podfile is configured, fuelpurchase-dev will
  link with fuelpurchase.a (which links with libPods.a which links with
  libPods-objc-commons.a).  This linking is natural, correct and unavoidable.
  fuelpurchase-dev ALSO links against libPods-fuelpurchase-dev.a which
  links with, among other things, libPods-fuelpurchase-dev-objc-commons.a.  So,
  fuelpurchase-dev.a has duplicate symbol definitions for objc-commons.  The
  fix is that libPods-fuelpurchase-dev-objc-commons.a should not be linked
  with libPods-fuelpurchase-dev.a.  This has to be done manually after the
  Pods have been installed (or updated).  So, again, the manual config change is to
  navigate to the Pods-fuelpurchase-dev target, and remove the reference
  to "libPods-fuelpurchase-dev-objc-commons.a" from the "Link Binary" step
  of the build phases.  After pod install/update,
  it will also have to be manually removed from the "Link Binary" step
  of the Pods-fuelpurchase-dev target.

+ In fuelpurchase and fuelpurchase-dev targets, you need to manually add an
entry to the "Copy Bundle Resources" build phase.  You need to add:
"Pods/IQKeyboardManager/IQKeyboardManager bundle to it
