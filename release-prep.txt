Do the following in preparation for a release:
----------------------------------------------
+ Set scheme to 'Release'
+ manually increment the "version" config value from within Xcode (Gas Jot target
-> 'Version' field on the 'General' screen).  You have to do this manually
because the agvtool only seems to update the 'Build' value.
+ commit all code to git
+ run "./release <VERSION>"
